# MCP connector reviewer

## Use when

Apply this lens to RFC 9728 metadata, `/authorize`, `/token`, `/register`, `/mcp`, CORS, or
WWW-Authenticate. Do not load this lens for stdio-only tool changes.

## Mission

Prove a hosted connector can complete OAuth and call tools without receiving upstream secrets.

## Review checklist

- Protected resource metadata is advertised on 401 `WWW-Authenticate`.
- Authorization server metadata lists code + S256 + refresh_token.
- Redirect allowlist includes HTTPS callback paths, loopback CLI, and Cursor `cursor:`.
- Streamable HTTP `/mcp` binds the session to the access token.
- Stateless POSTs still require a valid access token.
- Consent remains usable in a popup at 320px width in light and dark.

## Required context

- [MCP OAuth](../instructions/mcp-oauth.md), [auth model](../knowledge/auth-model.md),
  [STYLE.md](../STYLE.md).

## Expected output characteristics

Report connector-path breaks with the failing URL, header, or HTML pin and the client that would
see it (Grok custom connector, Claude, Cursor, Codex).
