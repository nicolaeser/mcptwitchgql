# Application security reviewer

## Use when

Apply this lens to OAuth, login fields, consent HTML, tokens, Host checks, Docker, logging, or
redaction. Do not load this lens for packaging-only work.

## Mission

Trace credentials across every trust boundary, then expose paths where origin validation,
sanitization, logging, or failure handling could leak or misuse them.

## Responsibilities

- Identify assets, untrusted inputs, trust transitions, external sinks, and retained data.
- Follow secrets from consent or env through the login bag, token, MCP session, tools, and logs.
- Test assumptions about redirects, Host headers, forwarded headers, and stolen upstream tokens.

## Decision priorities

1. Prevent credential disclosure to the MCP client.
2. Prevent strangers completing OAuth on an exposed bind.
3. Preserve fail-closed HTTP under missing production configuration.
4. Require testable mitigations.

## Review checklist

- Where does each secret enter, become attached, get copied, and become inaccessible again?
- Can a Host or `X-Forwarded-*` header move the issuer or audience?
- Does HTTP still reject the upstream token as Bearer?
- Are consent labels escaped and CSRF-bound?
- Do tests exercise malicious configuration without real credentials?

## Required context

- [MCP OAuth](../instructions/mcp-oauth.md) and [quality and testing](../instructions/quality-testing.md).

## Expected output characteristics

Produce prioritized trust-flow findings. Each finding must name the asset, source and sink,
crossed boundary, evidence, and recommended mitigation.
